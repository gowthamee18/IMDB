IMDb Movie Database Analysis

Project Overview

Provide a brief description of the project, including what it aims to accomplish and the significance of the analysis. You can mention the tools and technologies used in the project (e.g., SQL, databases, etc.).

Example:
This project involves the analysis of the IMDb movie database, focusing on various aspects like movie release trends, production statistics, genre analysis, ratings, and crew information. The goal is to extract valuable insights related to movie trends, production house performance, and movie ratings that could help stakeholders in the film industry make informed decisions.

Data Source

Describe the data source you’re working with. In this case, it’s an IMDb movie dataset.

Example:
The data used in this project is derived from the IMDb movie database, containing information about movies, ratings, genres, production companies, directors, actors, and more. The database includes tables such as movie, genre, director_mapping, role_mapping, names, and ratings.

Installation & Setup

Explain how to set up and run the project locally. Include any dependencies or requirements to run the project.

Example:
To get started, follow these steps:
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone <repository_url>


	2.	Install necessary dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


	3.	Set up the database:
	•	If you’re using a local database, make sure to configure the database connection in the config file.
	4.	Run the analysis script:

python analysis.py



Project Structure

Outline the structure of the project and what each file/folder does.

Example:

├── data/                  # Contains raw data files
├── analysis.py            # Python script to analyze the IMDb database
├── queries/               # SQL queries used for analysis
├── requirements.txt       # Required Python dependencies
├── README.md              # Project documentation
└── config.py              # Configuration file for database connection

Analysis & Insights

Summarize the key findings and insights from the analysis. This section is where you explain the most important results, trends, or conclusions you reached.

Example:
	•	Most Popular Genre: Drama is the genre with the highest number of movies produced, followed by Thriller and Comedy.
	•	Trends in Movie Releases: A majority of movies are released in the months of September, October, and November, with 2017 seeing the highest number of releases (3052 movies).
	•	Top Directors & Actors: Directors like Balavalli Darshith Bhat and Srinivas Gundareddy have produced some of the highest-rated movies. Actors like Aamir Qureshi and Aarav Mavi lead with a 10.0 median rating.
	•	Production House Performance: Dream Warrior Picture is the top production house based on the number of movies with an average rating above 8.

Queries

Provide a list of key SQL queries used in your analysis and their purpose.

Example:
	•	Query to find the total number of rows in each table:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM movie;


	•	Query to determine the number of movies released in the USA or India in 2019:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM movie WHERE (country = 'USA' OR country = 'India') AND year = 2019;


	•	Query to calculate the average movie duration by genre:

SELECT genre, AVG(duration) FROM movie JOIN genre ON movie.id = genre.movie_id GROUP BY genre;



Recommendations

Based on your analysis, provide recommendations on the types of movies or trends that movie production companies (or the relevant stakeholders) should focus on.

Example:
	•	Focus on Thrillers: Thriller is a popular genre with a substantial number of high-rated movies. Focusing on producing more Thriller content could attract more viewers.
	•	Increase Multi-Genre Production: Movies that belong to more than one genre tend to perform better. Producers should consider blending multiple genres in their projects.
	•	Leverage High-Rated Directors: Directors like Srinivas Gundareddy, who consistently deliver highly-rated films, should be given priority in future projects.
